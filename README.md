This program takes in thousands of tweets and outputs metrics about them. More specifically this java file reads from two .txt files, one with a list of tweets taken and one with a list of countries along with their country codes. After reading those files the code will output two aspects about various types of metrics. The first being the number of unique elements in that metric and the second the most common element in that matrix. Finally if you want to get the frequency of any specific phrase in the set of tweets you can do that and see that result displayed visually using standard draw.
